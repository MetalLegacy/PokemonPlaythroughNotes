A static website for keeping track of thoughts on playthroughs of various Pokemon games.

I essentially created this entire site in Google Sheets, was annoyed at a one single thing that couldn't work exactly how I wanted it to, so I decided to make it myself. This is my first ever web dev project and I'm fairly happy with how it came out. I'm sure the actual code is a mess, but the site itself works how I want so I'll take it.

Credits for most images are in the respective folder, however all images of the Pokemon themselves came from PokemonDB.net
